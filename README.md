# Factory Design Pattern
# In a factory design pattern we promote low coupling and strong cohesion by building a class that is responsible of creating certain #objects and that class is created with only one purpose which is creating objects of that class.
# We start by Creating the class for example: public class Student.
# Inside the class we will create a public and static method for exmple: public static Student createStudent()
